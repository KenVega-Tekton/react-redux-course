A Chat With Redux

-React
  Hey CourseAction, someone clicked this "Save Course" button.
  
-Action
  Thanks React! I will dispatch an action so reducers that care can update state.

-Reducer
  Ah, thanks action. I see you passed me the current state and the action to perform. I'll make a new copy of the state and return it. 

-Store
  Thanks for updating the state reducer. I'll make sure that all connected components are aware.
  
-React-Redux
  Woah, thanks for the new data Mr. Store. I'll now Intelligently determine If I should tell React about this change so that It only has to bother with updating the UI when necessary.
  
- React
  Ohh! Shiny new data has been passed down via props from the store! I'll update the UI to reflect this!
